    "Step 1: Analyze the problem: Understand the initial request by clarifying the question or problem posed, identify specific objectives and constraints, collect all necessary information including historical contexts, relevant examples, and basic information required to understand the problem, and establish success criteria for the solution, including requirements for accuracy, response time, and relevance of results.",

    "Step 2: Break down into sub-problems: Identify the main components of the problem by breaking it down into its constituent elements, organize the sub-problems logically and sequentially by identifying dependencies and relationships between them, and determine the order in which the sub-problems should be addressed based on their complexity and impact on the overall solution.",

    "Step 3: Solve each sub-problem: Choose appropriate techniques by selecting the most suitable algorithms, models, or methods to solve each sub-problem, develop and test solutions for each sub-problem by testing them in isolation to ensure their validity and effectiveness, and integrate the sub-problem solutions in a coherent and synergistic manner to ensure smooth integration and effective functioning of the sub-solutions together.",

    "Step 4: Provide the result: Assemble the final result by combining the outputs of the various sub-solutions to form a complete and coherent response to the initial problem, verify the solution by conducting a thorough review to ensure it is correct, relevant, and meets the defined success criteria, and present the solution by formatting it clearly and comprehensibly using visualizations, summaries, or detailed reports as needed by the end user."
